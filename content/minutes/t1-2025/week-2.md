## Actionables Completed

#### Booking Recording Studio

- Very good, sound quality was great
- Made editing a lot easier

## Agenda Items

- Went over last week's minutes

Podcast:
- Podcast episode 2; "probably the best episode weve done" - Mia
- 300+ listerns, big improvement from last year
- Laying out what we are going to say beforehand was much better than previous method, better flow
- 2 week release cycle is much better on everyone

Short form:
- New person (name here) has been taking old written content and turning into short form
- Will come back to us with the pitch version
- We sit in a board room discussing how to appeal to gen alpha

SRC Coverage:
- Mias method:
  Pros:
    - Very detailed
    - No one gets upset
    - People enjoy it
    - General set up was good
  Cons:
    - Being in person was rough
    - Being up until 4 am is not fair

- SRC meetings now go a lot faster in person and due to the charter changes, becoming really hard to keep up with live stories
- Switch to bluesky? Not qute the same, doesn't put names to faces
- Do some beforehand using the submitted motions? Doesn't actually solve the problem since its not the part that takes time
- Instead post on the next day? Will try next time

Pubs Schedule:
- Updated schedule
- SRC on Friday (Billy)
- Queerspace next Monday (Ren)
- Q&A about trimesters next Wensday (Pepsi)
- Scout AI next Friday (Luke)
